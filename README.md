# SEC-10k
In this project, we store the SEC form 10k data for 4 companies using MongoDB.
I have used pymongo to connect to MongoDB and upload the financial data, company details, form 10k data along with the exhibits.
Using ipython notebook i have connected to the mongoDB and tried some visualizations and used pandas.
Will update more of the analysis soon.
