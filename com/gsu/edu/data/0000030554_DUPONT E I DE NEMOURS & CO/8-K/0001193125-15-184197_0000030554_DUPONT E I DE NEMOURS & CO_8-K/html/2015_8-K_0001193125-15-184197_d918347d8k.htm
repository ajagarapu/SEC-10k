recognition of the assets contributed to it by DuPont in anticipation of the Separation. DuPont expects to return an amount equal to substantially all of the aggregate proceeds from the Chemours distributions to DuPont stockholders through share

Securities (USA) LLC and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, as representatives of the dollar purchasers of the 2023 notes and 2025 notes and Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC and J.P. Morgan Securities plc, as representatives of the Euro purchasers of the
Euro notes (the &#147;Registration Rights Agreement&#148;).&nbsp;The Registration Rights Agreement requires Chemours and the Guarantors, at their cost, to, among other things, use their commercially reasonable efforts to effect a registered exchange
offer of the Notes and the Guarantees for registered notes and guarantees with identical terms (except for the transfer restrictions relating to the Notes and additional interest provisions) no later than August&nbsp;20, 2016, which is 465 days

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On May&nbsp;12, 2015, Chemours entered into a credit agreement (the &#147;Credit Agreement&#148;) with a syndicate of banks providing for a
seven-year $1.5 billion senior secured Term Loan B Facility (the &#147;Term Loan Facility&#148;) and a five-year $1.0 billion senior secured Revolving Credit Facility (&#147;the Revolving Credit Facility&#148; and together with the Term Loan
Facility, the &#147;Senior Secured Credit Facilities&#148;). </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Credit Agreement permits Chemours, subject to customary conditions, to
incur incremental term loan borrowings and/or increase commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility in an aggregate amount not greater than (i)&nbsp;$700 million plus (ii)&nbsp;an unlimited amount, so long as, on a pro forma basis after giving
effect to any such increases, its senior secured net leverage ratio does not exceed 1.50 to 1.00. Incremental term loan borrowings and revolving commitments are uncommitted and the availability thereof will depend on market conditions at the time
Chemours seeks to incur such borrowings and/or commitments. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Senior Secured Credit Facilities bear interest, at Chemours&#146; option,
at a rate equal to an adjusted base rate or LIBOR, plus, in each case, an applicable margin. In the case of the Term Loan Facility, the adjusted base rate and LIBOR will not, in any event, be less than 1.75% and 0.75%, respectively. The applicable
margin is equal to, (i)&nbsp;in the case of the Term Loan Facility, 2.00% for base rate loans and 3.00% for LIBOR loans and (ii)&nbsp;in the case of the Revolving Credit Facility, a range based on our total net leverage ratio between (a)&nbsp;0.50%
and 1.25% for base rate loans and (b)&nbsp;1.50% and 2.25% for LIBOR loans. Chemours is required to pay a commitment fee on the average daily unused amount of the Revolving Credit Facility at a rate based on its total net leverage ratio, between
0.20% and 0.35%. With respect to outstanding letters of credit issued under the Revolving Credit Facility, Chemours is required to pay letter of credit fees equal to the product of (A)&nbsp;the applicable margin with respect to Eurocurrency
borrowings and (B)&nbsp;the average amount available to be drawn under such letters of credit, as well as customary fronting fees. Interest, commitment fees and letter of credit fees are generally payable quarterly in arrears (or in the case of
borrowings with an interest period of 3 months or less, at the end of the applicable interest period). </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Term Loan Facility amortizes
in equal quarterly installments equal to 1.00%&nbsp;per annum, with the balance due at maturity. Chemours is permitted to voluntarily prepay loans and/or reduce the commitment under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, in whole or in part, without
penalty or premium subject to certain minimum amounts and increments and the payment of customary breakage costs; provided that any prepayment of the Term Loan Facility on or prior to twelve months after the credit facility effective date with
proceeds from a re-pricing transaction will require a prepayment premium equal to 1.00% of such loans prepaid. Mandatory prepayments are not required under the Revolving Credit Facility. Mandatory prepayments are required under the Term Loan
Facility using the net cash proceeds from certain asset sales, casualty and condemnation events and indebtedness and from excess cash flow (each subject to customary thresholds and exclusions). </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">If the Separation has not been completed on or before November&nbsp;30, 2015, or if prior to such date, DuPont has abandoned the Separation,
then Chemours will be required to repay all loans outstanding under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities together with all accrued and unpaid interest and fees, and the commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility will be terminated. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Chemours&#146; obligations under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities are guaranteed on a senior secured basis by all of its material domestic
subsidiaries, subject to certain agreed upon exceptions. The obligations under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities are also, subject to certain agreed upon exceptions, secured by a first priority lien on substantially all of Chemours and its
material wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries&#146; assets, including 100% of the stock of domestic subsidiaries and 65% of the stock of certain foreign subsidiaries. </P>
