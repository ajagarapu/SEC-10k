<DIV><FONT size="1" style="font-size:1pt;color:white">1   Regulation G   The attached charts include company information that does not conform to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Management believes that an analysis of   this data is meaningful to investors because it provides insight with respect to ongoing operating results of the company.  These measures should not be viewed as an   alternative to GAAP measures of performance. Furthermore, these measures may not be consistent with similar measures provided by other companies. This data should   be read in conjunction with previously published company reports on Forms 10-K, 10-Q, and 8-K.  These reports, along with reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to   GAAP are available on the Investor Center of www.dupont.com under Filings and Reports &#8211; Reconciliations and Other Data. Reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to   GAAP are also included with this presentation.      Forward-Looking Statements   This document contains forward-looking statements which may be identified by their use of words like &#8220;plans,&#8221; &#8220;expects,&#8221; &#8220;will,&#8221; &#8220;believes,&#8221; &#8220;intends,&#8221; &#8220;estimates,&#8221;   &#8220;anticipates&#8221; or other words of similar meaning.  All statements that address expectations or projections about the future, including statements about the company&#39;s strategy   for growth, product development, regulatory approval, market position, anticipated benefits of recent acquisitions, timing of anticipated benefits from restructuring actions,   outcome of contingencies, such as litigation and environmental matters, expenditures and financial results, are forward looking statements. Forward-looking statements are   not guarantees of future performance and are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events which may not be realized. Forward-looking statements also   involve risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond the company&#8217;s control. Some of the important factors that could cause the company&#8217;s actual results to differ   materially from those projected in any such forward-looking statements are: fluctuations in energy and raw material prices; failure to develop and market new products and   optimally manage product life cycles; significant litigation and environmental matters; failure to appropriately manage process safety and product stewardship issues;   changes in laws and regulations or political conditions; global economic and capital markets conditions, such as inflation, interest and currency exchange rates; business or   supply disruptions; security threats, such as acts of sabotage, terrorism or war, weather events and natural disasters; abili ty to protect and enforce the company&#39;s   intellectual property rights; successful integration of acquired businesses and separation of underperforming or non-strategic assets or businesses and successful   completion of the proposed spinoff of the Performance Chemicals segment including ability to fully realize the expected benefits of the proposed spinoff. The company   undertakes no duty to update any forward-looking statements as a result of future developments or new information.      Developing Markets   Total developing markets is comprised of Developing Asia, Developing Europe, Middle East &amp; Africa, and Latin America.  A detailed list of all developing countries is   available on the Earnings News Release link on the Investor Center website at www.dupont.com.

<DIV><FONT size="1" style="font-size:1pt;color:white">Segment Commentary    Fourth Quarter Earnings 2014   19   Agriculture   In our Agriculture segment, fourth quarter sales are largely driven by the summer and Safrinha seasons in Latin America and   shipments to customers in advance of the 2015 planting season in the northern hemisphere.  Sales for the quarter were 4   percent below the prior year as volume growth in crop protection and the timing of seed shipments for the 2015 planting   season were more than offset by lower corn seed sales in Brazil and the negative impact of currency.  Fourth quarter   operating earnings of $129 million increased $41 million as lower costs, productivity improvements and gains from portfolio   actions of $36 million more than offset the decline in sales.     For the full year, operating earnings decreased 5 percent as higher crop protection volumes, higher local seed prices and   lower costs, including seed inputs, were more than offset by lower corn seed volumes, the negative impact of currency and   portfolio impacts.  During the year we took disciplined actions to streamline our cost structure, further focus our investments   on the highest growth opportunities and better position ourselves for the current economic environment.   Crop protection sales for the quarter were 1 percent lower as volume growth from most regions was more than offset by the   negative impact of currency and from portfolio changes.  For the full year, crop protection sales grew 4 percent in a   challenging market environment led by insecticides and fungicides while herbicide sales declined.  We saw further growth in   2014 from Rynaxypyr&#174; and from successful launches of Cyazypyr&#174; and our new seed treatments in several markets.   Moving to the seed business, fourth quarter sales declined 7 percent due in part to strong currency headwinds.  In Brazil,   corn seed market share and price were lower reflecting the impact of fall armyworm resistance.  Brazil corn volumes were   also negatively impacted as farmers planted fewer hectares of corn.  Fourth quarter shipments in  North America and   Europe were higher than the prior year in advance of 2015 planting.  For the full year, seed sales declined 7 percent as   higher local seed price from new products was more than offset by reductions in corn planted area and market share   declines in Brazil and North America.        </FONT></DIV>

<DIV><FONT size="1" style="font-size:1pt;color:white">Segment Commentary    Fourth Quarter Earnings 2014   20   Agriculture (continued)   As we look to the near future, we expect the economic environment in the agriculture sector to remain challenged.    Farmer net income has declined and growers in Brazil&#8217;s Safrinha season and in North America are likely to reduce corn   plantings again in 2015 putting pressure on volumes in the first half of the year.  Our seed order book reflects this shift in   acres.  In addition, lower insect pressure in Brazil and continued elevated distributor inventories in the Americas will   present headwinds in 2015 in crop protection markets.   Farmers are increasing demand for our newest corn seed genetics, our AcreMax&#174; integrated refuge corn products and   our new T series soybean varieties.  However, with profits coming down, farmers are sharpening their pencils when it   comes to input purchases.  Coupled with strong industry seed supplies, 2015 continues to be a very dynamic and   competitive season.     We anticipate currencies will remain volatile and headwinds to be substantial in markets like Europe, Brazil and Canada   where we have seen strong growth in our market position in recent years.   For the first half of 2015, which reflects the   majority of the northern hemisphere season, we expect Agriculture segment sales to be mid-single digits percent lower   with operating earnings about 10 percent below 2014 as price gains from new product mix are more than offset by   currency and lower volumes.  The currency impact will be greatest in the first quarter when the majority of 2015 season   sales in Europe occur.  Volumes will be more challenged in the first quarter due to an expected decline in North America   and Brazil Safrinha corn area, the earlier timing of northern hemisphere seed shipments which benefited the fourth quarter   of 2014, and a reduction in herbicide volumes.  We expect first quarter sales to be about 10 percent lower and operating   earnings about 25 percent below 2014.     For the full year we expect sales to be down low-single digits percent and operating earnings down high-single digits   percent as price gains from new seed and crop protection products are more than offset by currency headwinds.    Excluding the impact of currency, we would expect operating earnings to be up mid- to high-single digits.        </FONT></DIV>

We are excited about our   near-term pipeline of new genetics and traits like event DP4114 and Leptra&#8482; insect protection in seeds.  Leptra&#8482; will   bring an additional mode of control to help Brazilian farmers manage the intense pressure they face from insects,   including fall armyworm.  In crop protection our robust pipeline of new actives will continue to complement our recent   launches of insecticides and fungicides and our expanding seed treatment portfolio.        </FONT></DIV>

Segment volumes increased 4 percent on solid demand in auto, packaging, industrial, and consumer markets.    Demand for Performance Polymers, especially in China and North America, remained strong in the auto sector.   China   volumes were up approximately 15 percent year over year which more than offset lower demand in Europe, Japan, and   Korea. In packaging, industrial, and consumer markets, specialty and commodity ethylene copolymer demand remained   solid and ethylene sales were up versus the prior year.     In the quarter, operating earnings increased 13 percent as higher volumes, prices and lower costs  more than offset the   negative impacts of currency and portfolio changes.  Operating margins increased 340 basis points on favorable   ethylene market dynamics and higher volumes.      In 2014, full year operating earnings were up 1 percent, overcoming the negative impacts of portfolio changes and the   60 day planned ethylene outage.  Operating margins increased 70 basis points to close the year at 21 percent.   For the first quarter, we anticipate sales will be down in the mid-single digits percent range due primarily to currency and   portfolio impacts, ex portfolio sales up mid-single digits.   Operating earnings are expected to be up in the mid-teens however on a percentage basis on improved volumes as   prior year sales were constrained in advance of the scheduled ethylene outage.   In 2015, we anticipate strong volumes will be more than offset by the combined negative impact of portfolio, price, and   currency, resulting in sales down mid-single digits.  Full year operating earnings are expected to increase in the mid-   single digit range however as higher volumes more than offset the negative impact of currency.        </FONT></DIV>

<DIV><FONT size="1" style="font-size:1pt;color:white">Segment Commentary    Fourth Quarter Earnings 2014   23   Industrial Biosciences   Industrial Biosciences sales of $322 million were 1 percent lower as 2 percent higher volumes were more than offset by   the impact of currency.    Growth in enzymes was driven by new product offerings and increased sales into emerging   markets while biomaterials volumes were lower on weaker demand in key US markets.   Sales from recently launched enzyme offerings in ethanol, animal nutrition and food enzyme markets contributed to   positive volume growth in the quarter.   Ethanol industry fundamentals are adjusting to a lower energy cost environment   but demand for DuPont&#8217;s novel enzymes and other functional bio products designed to increase production rates, yield   and efficiency remained steady.  In 2015, enzyme demand for ethanol production is expected to remain stable although   ethanol producer margins are expected to transition from their peak levels in 2014.       Fourth quarter operating earnings were up 23 percent on higher volumes with a stronger product mix and lower costs.         For the full year 2014, higher volumes and improved mix from the continued ramp of new products helped deliver a 25   percent increase in operating earnings and a 300 basis point increase in operating margins.    For the 1st quarter 2015, we anticipate higher segment volumes will be offset by the negative impacts of currency and   lower prices, resulting in sales even with the prior year.  First quarter operating earnings are also expected to be even   with the prior year.     For the full year, we expect sales will be flat but higher volumes and stronger mix will result in earnings up in the high-   teens on a percentage basis.           </FONT></DIV>

Volume growth in several product   lines was more than offset by competitive pressures impacting Solamet&#174; paste and the pass-through of lower metals   prices.  Operating earnings of $97 million increased $4 million, or 4 percent, as lower volumes were offset by lower   costs and productivity improvements.   Full year sales were 6 percent lower as volume growth in several product lines was more than offset by lower metals   prices and by competitive pressures in photovoltaic paste.  Full year 2014 operating earnings of $355 million increased   $21 million, or 6 percent, on volume growth and productivity gains, partially offset by the absence of $20 million in   OLED licensing income realized during 2013.   Looking ahead to 2015, global photovoltaic module installations are expected to grow about 20 percent fueled by   installations in China, Japan, the U.S. and in developing markets.  We expect continued strength in Tedlar&#174; film,   consumer electronics and packaging graphics.  In the short-term, we expect segment results will continue to be   negatively impacted by declines in Solamet&#174; paste, as intense competition has impacted price and share in this   business.  We are the market and technology leader in photovoltaics and are driving a robust innovation pipeline aimed   at furthering solar cell efficiency and module lifetime.  We have begun testing a new metallized paste product for the PV   market with customers, and expect to ramp up production in 2015.   For the first quarter we expect sales to be down about 10 percent from short-term challenges in PV paste and lower   metals prices with operating earnings about flat, benefitting from productivity.  We expect to see the impact of our new   photovoltaic paste products in the second half of the year.  Full year sales are expected to be up low-single digits   percent from volume gains offset by the pass-through of lower metals prices.  For the year we expect operating   earnings to be up in the high-teens percent range.        </FONT></DIV>

Operating earnings increased $1 million as the negative impact of currency   and unfavorable mix were offset by a gain on termination of a distribution agreement of $18 million and lower costs.    This was the sixth consecutive quarter of year-over-year operating margin improvement.   Our disciplined focus on productivity and mix enrichment is paying off as operating margins improved over 200 basis   points for the full year.  2014 was a strong year for the segment as full year operating earnings grew 27 percent from   improved product mix, volume growth, productivity and a gain on termination of a distribution agreement, partially offset   by the negative impact of currency.     Market conditions are expected to remain challenging in Europe where the Russia food import ban continues to have   an effect and currency will be a strong headwind.  In the first quarter, we expect sales and operating earnings to be   about flat with broad-based volume gains negated by the impact of currency.     Full year sales are expected to be about flat with broad-based volume gains offset by currency.  Full year operating   earnings are expected to be mid-single digits percent higher benefitting from lower raw material costs, improved mix   and a continued focus on productivity, further expanding operating margins.      </FONT></DIV>

Higher volumes in industrial markets, including demand for Nomex&#174; thermal resistant fiber, Kevlar&#174; high strength materials   and Tyvek&#174; protective material, were offset by currency.       Nomex&#174; demand growth was fueled by thermal industrial and energy solutions applications.  Kevlar&#174; demand growth was   driven by increased sales into the public and transportation sectors.  Tyvek&#174; demand was driven by industrial demand and   the global Ebola response.  Regionally, sales volume growth in Europe, the United States, and Canada, was offset by lower   volumes in Latin America.       Fourth quarter segment operating earnings of $209 million were flat year over year.  Operating earnings benefitted from   improved margins, increased demand from industrial markets, lower costs, and continued benefits from productivity were   offset by portfolio changes and currency.      Full year 2014 operating earnings of $794 million increased $104 million, or 15 percent, from higher volumes driven by   increased demand for Nomex&#174; thermal resistant fiber and Kevlar&#174; high strength materials, productivity improvements and   lower product costs, partially offset by lower sales from clean technologies offerings and portfolio changes.  Operating   margins were up 260 basis points versus prior year.   In the first quarter 2015, volume growth in the mid-to-high single digits percent will be more than offset by the impact of   currency and portfolio changes. Operating earnings growth in the mid-single digit percent range on mix enrichment and   sustained operational productivity.

Volumes were up 3 percent on solid   demand for chemicals and fluoroproducts.  In Ti02, volumes were flat  and prices were down 7 percent from the prior year,   6 percent on a sequential basis. Competitive pressures in Ti02 remain high as soft industry fundamentals, especially in   Europe, contributed to lower prices in the quarter.   We believe industry utilization rates remain essentially unchanged with    inventory levels near normal.     Operating earnings were down 1 percent as gains from the sales of non-strategic assets, higher volumes and lower costs   were more than offset by lower segment prices, currency and portfolio impacts.  The fourth quarter included a gain of $23   million from the sale of a business.
