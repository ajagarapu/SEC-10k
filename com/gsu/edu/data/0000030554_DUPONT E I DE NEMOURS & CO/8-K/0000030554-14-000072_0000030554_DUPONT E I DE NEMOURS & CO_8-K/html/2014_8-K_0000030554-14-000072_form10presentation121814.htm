<DIV><FONT size="1" style="font-size:1pt;color:white">2         Forward Looking Statements   This document contains forward-looking statements which may be identified by their use of words like &#8220;plans,&#8221; &#8220;expects,&#8221; &#8220;will,&#8221; &#8220;believes,&#8221;   &#8220;intends,&#8221; &#8220;estimates,&#8221; &#8220;anticipates&#8221; or other words of similar meaning.  All statements that address expectations or projections about the   future, including statements about the company&#39;s strategy for growth, product development, regulatory approval, market position, anticipated   benefits of recent acquisitions, timing of anticipated benefits from restructuring actions, outcome of contingencies, such as litigation and   environmental matters, expenditures and financial results, are forward looking statements. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of   future performance and are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events which may not be realized. Forward-looking   statements also involve risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond the company&#8217;s control. Some of the important factors that could   cause the company&#8217;s actual results to differ materially from those projected in any such forward-looking statements are: fluctuations in energy   and raw material prices; failure to develop and market new products and optimally manage product life cycles; significant litigation and   environmental matters; failure to appropriately manage process safety and product stewardship issues; changes in laws and regulations or   political conditions; global economic and capital markets conditions, such as inflation, interest and currency exchange rates; business or   supply disruptions; security threats, such as acts of sabotage, terrorism or war, weather events and natural disasters; ability to protect and   enforce the company&#39;s intellectual property rights; successful integration of acquired businesses and separation of underperforming or non-   strategic assets or businesses and successful completion of the proposed spinoff of the Performance Chemicals segment including ability to   fully realize the expected benefits of the proposed spinoff. The company undertakes no duty to update any forward-looking statements as a   result of future developments or new information.   Additional Information And Where To Find It   DuPont intends to file a proxy statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the &quot;SEC&quot;) with respect to the 2015 Annual   Meeting.  DUPONT STOCKHOLDERS ARE STRONGLY ENCOURAGED TO READ ANY SUCH PROXY STATEMENT, THE   ACCOMPANYING WHITE PROXY CARD AND OTHER DOCUMENTS FILED WITH THE SEC CAREFULLY IN THEIR ENTIRETY WHEN   THEY BECOME AVAILABLE BECAUSE THEY WILL CONTAIN IMPORTANT INFORMATION.    DuPont, its directors, executive officers and other employees may be deemed to be participants in the solicitation of proxies from DuPont   stockholders in connection with the matters to be considered at DuPont&#8217;s 2015 Annual Meeting.  Information about DuPont&#8217;s directors and   executive officers is available in DuPont&#8217;s proxy statement, dated March 14, 2014, for its 2014 Annual Meeting. To the extent holdings of   DuPont&#8217;s securities by such directors or executive officers have changed since the amounts printed in the 2014 proxy statement, such   changes have been or will be reflected on Statements of Change in Ownership on Form 4 filed with the SEC.  More detailed information   regarding the identity of potential participants, and their direct or indirect interests, by security holdings or otherwise, will be set forth in the   proxy statement and other materials to be filed with the SEC in connection with DuPont&#8217;s 2015 Annual Meeting. Stockholders will be able to   obtain any proxy statement, any amendments or supplements to the proxy statement and other documents filed by DuPont with the SEC free   of charge at the SEC&#39;s website at www.sec.gov. Copies will also be available free of charge at DuPont&#8217;s website at www.dupont.com or by   contacting DuPont Investor Relations at (302) 774-4994.        </FONT></DIV>
