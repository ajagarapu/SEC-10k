<DIV><FONT size="1" style="font-size:1pt;color:white">1   Regulation G   The attached charts include company information that does not conform to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).   Management believes that an analysis of this data is meaningful to investors because it provides insight with respect to ongoing operating   results of the company.  These measures should not be viewed as an alternative to GAAP measures of performance. Furthermore, these   measures may not be consistent with similar measures provided by other companies. This data should be read in conjunction with   previously published company reports on Forms 10-K, 10-Q, and 8-K.  These reports, along with reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to   GAAP are available on the Investor Center of www.dupont.com under Filings and Reports &#8211; Reconciliations and Other Data.   Reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to GAAP are also included with this presentation.      Forward-Looking Statements   This document contains forward-looking statements which may be identified by their use of words like &#8220;plans,&#8221; &#8220;expects,&#8221; &#8220;will,&#8221; &#8220;believes,&#8221;   &#8220;intends,&#8221; &#8220;estimates,&#8221; &#8220;anticipates&#8221; or other words of similar meaning. All statements that address expectations or projections about the   future, including statements about the company&#8217;s strategy for growth, product development, regulatory approval, market position,   anticipated benefits of recent acquisitions, timing of anticipated benefits from restructuring actions, outcome of contingencies, such as   litigation and environmental matters, expenditures and financial results, are forward looking statements. Forward-looking statements are   not guarantees of future performance and are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events which may not be realized.   Forward-looking statements also involve risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond the company&#8217;s control. Some of the important   factors that could cause the company&#8217;s actual results to differ materially from those projected in any such forward-looking statements are:   fluctuations in energy and raw material prices; failure to develop and market new products and optimally manage product life cycles; ability   to respond to market acceptance, rules, regulations and policies affecting products based on biotechnology; significant litigation and   environmental matters; failure to appropriately manage process safety and product stewardship issues; changes in laws and regulations or   political conditions; global economic and capital markets conditions, such as inflation, interest and currency exchange rates; business or   supply disruptions; security threats, such as acts of sabotage, terrorism or war, weather events and natural disasters; ability to protect and   enforce the company&#8217;s intellectual property rights; successful integration of acquired businesses and separation of underperforming or non-   strategic assets or businesses, including timely realization of the expected benefits from the separation of  Performance Chemicals. The   company undertakes no duty to update any forward-looking statements as a result of future developments or new information.       Developing Markets   Total developing markets is comprised of Developing Asia, Developing Europe, Middle East &amp; Africa, and Latin America.  A detailed list of   all developing countries is available on the Earnings News Release link on the Investor Center website at www.dupont.com.            </FONT></DIV>

Portfolio and currency reduced sales by 13   percent.       Segment volume increased 3 percent primarily due to increased ethylene sales and Performance Polymers growth in   North America and Europe.   Prior year ethylene sales were constrained due to the planned maintenance outage.       Operating earnings were up 3 percent as higher volumes, stronger mix, and productivity more than offset $42 million of   negative impact from currency.  Excluding the impact of currency, operating earnings would have increased by about 17   percent. An unplanned ethylene outage negatively impacted operating earnings.  Operating margins increased ~360bps   due to mix enrichment and productivity.   In global automotive markets, demand is relatively soft as recent IHS forecasts show 2nd Quarter auto builds down ~1   percent  on continued downward revisions.  While the 3rd quarter auto builds forecast is higher than prior year, China    and Asia Pacific demand in general was sluggish in 2Q.         In the third quarter, we anticipate sales will be down about 10 percent and operating earnings down in the high teens due   primarily to currency and lower ethylene prices.  In the prior year, spot ethylene prices were at record levels, exceeding   $.70 cents per lb which impacts the year over year comparison.  We anticipate lower raw material costs will provide a   favorable impact, partially offset by lower ethylene prices.

Excluding the impact of currency, operating earnings   would have increased by about 8 percent. Sales were 13 percent lower as volume growth in Tedlar&#174; film in photovoltaics   and consumer electronics related businesses was more than offset by the impact of competitive pressures on sales of   Solamet&#174; paste, the negative impact of currency and lower metals pricing.        We continue to expect global photovoltaic module installations will grow about 20 percent for the year driven by China,   the U.S. and Japan, supporting strong demand for our Tedlar&#174; film products.  In the second quarter we launched our   newest Solamet&#174; paste product, PV19a.  This is the first in a series of new, higher efficiency paste offerings and we   expect additional introductions later this year.       We expect third quarter sales to be down low-teens percent as increased demand for Tedlar&#174; film and for products used   in consumer electronics applications are offset by the negative impact of lower Solamet&#174; paste sales, metals pricing and   currency.  Operating earnings are expected to be about flat as productivity actions are offset by the impact of lower sales.   Excluding the impact of currency, we expect operating earnings to be up mid-single-digits percent.       For the full year, sales are expected to be down high-single digits percent on lower sales of Solamet&#174; paste, lower metals   prices and currency with operating earnings up low-single digits percent as productivity gains will more than offset the   negative impacts of currency.

Increased demand for Tyvek&#174; protective material, including medical packaging and protective   garments, was offset by lower demand from the oil and gas industry impacting Nomex&#174; thermal resistant fiber and   Sustainable Solutions offerings.             Second quarter segment operating earnings of $195 million were down 7 percent as productivity improvements were more   than offset by $20 million of negative impact from currency and the Sontara&#174; divestiture.  Excluding the impact of currency,   operating earnings would have increased by about 3 percent. Higher costs associated with an unplanned outage at the   Chambers Works facility in the first quarter continued to impact operating earnings in the second quarter.    Operating margins improved 80 basis points year over year reflecting improved mix and continued productivity.       In the third quarter, sales are expected to be down in the mid-single digit percent range as volume growth will be more than   offset by the impact of currency and portfolio changes. Operating earnings will be even with prior year as continued   demand for our products, ongoing innovation, and continued operational productivity will be offset by the negative impact   of currency.  Excluding the impact of currency, we expect operating earnings to be up mid-teens percent.

Volume growth in enzymes was driven by solid   demand in animal nutrition, health and personal care, and food markets.  Biomaterial sales were lower on soft demand for   carpet in the US residential home improvement market and channel destocking.         Operating earnings of $50 million were down 15 percent including a $6 million negative impact from currency.  Excluding   the impact of currency, operating earnings would have been about 5 percent lower than prior year. Continued volume and   productivity gains were more than offset by lower prices.       In the third quarter, we anticipate higher volumes will be offset by the negative impacts of currency and softer US   biomaterials prices resulting in sales down in the low single digit percent range.         We expect operating earnings up low-teens percent versus the prior year on higher volumes and improved mix.

Operating   earnings decreased $2 million as productivity gains mostly offset a $12 million negative impact from currency.  Excluding   the impact of currency, operating earnings would have increased by about 10 percent.   We delivered over 100 basis points   of operating margin improvement and have now grown operating margins year-over-year for eight consecutive quarters.       Sales were 11 percent lower, primarily due to a 9 percent negative impact from currency and the pass-through of lower   commodity prices in our soybean crush business.  We continue to deliver solid growth in probiotics, texturants, cultures,   and ingredient systems, partially offset by lower volumes in the specialty protein market in North America as a result of   customer destocking and competitive challenges.          In the third quarter, we expect continued volume growth in most product lines and the specialty protein market to remain   very competitive.  Sales are expected to be mid-single digits percent lower due to continued strong currency headwinds.    Operating earnings are expected to be high-single digits percent lower as the negative impact of currency will more than   offset volume growth and productivity gains. Excluding the impact of currency, we expect operating earnings to be up about   10 percent.       For the full year we now expect sales to be mid-single digits percent lower as volume gains are more than offset by   currency.  Operating earnings are expected to be about flat as both product margin expansion and productivity gains are   offset by currency.

<DIV><FONT size="1" style="font-size:1pt;color:white">Segment Commentary    Second Quarter Earnings 2015   23   Agriculture      In Agriculture, the industry continues to face challenging market conditions due to lower commodity prices and tight farmer   economics which led to lower corn planted area in North America and globally in the first half of the year.  In crop protection   markets, we saw weaker market demand from farmers looking to reduce input costs and delay purchases, lower insect   pressure in Brazil and the impact of higher inventories in the Americas .         Second quarter Agriculture segment sales were $3.2 billion, down 11 percent, as higher local prices were offset by 6 percent   lower volumes and a 5 percent negative impact from currency.  Seed sales were 7 percent lower and crop protection sales   were down 21 percent versus last year.        Despite 2015 being one of the most competitive seasons in recent years we have been able to realize local net price   increases for the quarter and across the northern hemisphere season.  New products in corn and soybean seeds   demonstrate that even in a tough economic and competitive environment growers around the world continue to demand   DuPont innovations that improve their productivity and help them manage risk.       Volume for the segment declined 6 percent due to lower soybean seed sales, lower crop protection volumes due to weaker   market demand and reduced global corn planted area.      Second quarter operating earnings decreased by 7 percent as productivity, continued discipline in spending and pricing   gains were more than offset by about $84 million negative currency impact and from lower volumes.  Excluding the impact of   currency, operating earnings would have grown about 3 percent.  Operating margins increased about 110 basis points in the   quarter.           </FONT></DIV>

<DIV><FONT size="1" style="font-size:1pt;color:white">Segment Commentary    Second Quarter Earnings 2015   24   Agriculture (continued)      As we turn to the second half of the year and the focus shifts to Latin America, we anticipate continuing strong headwinds   from currency, primarily the Brazilian real, which is about 40 percent weaker than a year ago, and from lower corn planted   area.  The cutoff between third quarter and fourth quarter comes in the middle of the Latin America season to which we are   seeing a slow start as farmers remain cautious given the economic environment.  For the third quarter we expect sales to be   down mid-teens percent as local pricing gains from new products are expected to be more than offset by very strong   currency headwinds, lower corn volumes and continued pressure on crop protection inputs.  We expect a seasonal   operating loss in the third quarter of about $225 million as productivity and cost actions are more than offset by currency and   lower volumes.  Fourth quarter operating earnings are expected to be similar to last year.       Looking at the full year, the company is reducing expectations for its Agriculture segment due to weaker demand in global   crop protection markets, reduced expectations for corn area in Latin America, and lower than expected soybean volumes in   North America. We now expect Agriculture segment sales to be high-single digits percent lower with operating earnings in   the low-twenty percent range below 2014 as local pricing gains, productivity and disciplined cost management are offset by   currency and lower volumes.  Currency remains the primary factor in the decline in 2015 results.  Excluding the impact of   weaker global currencies we expect operating earnings for the year would be down low-single digits percent.       While challenging markets in agriculture are likely to persist, we remain confident in long-term growth in demand for   agricultural products, in our strategy, and in our pipeline of new genetics, unique trait combinations and innovative crop   protection solutions.  We recently received cultivation approval in Brazil for Leptra&#8482; for insect control and are planning for   an introductory launch for the upcoming Safrinha season.  Corn Event DP4114 is progressing towards commercialization   and we are testing it broadly across North America this summer in our IMPACT&#174; trials as we await final import approvals in   key markets.  In crop protection we continue to receive registrations of Cyazypyr&#174; for insect control in additional countries,   are growing our seed treatment portfolio, and are preparing for new launches of Zorvec&#8482; fungicide and Pyraxalt&#8482; for insect   control in rice, pending regulatory approvals.         </FONT></DIV>

Challenging industry fundamentals continued as TiO2 local prices declined 12 percent and currency remained a significant   headwind.  On a sequential basis, Ti02 prices were down 8 percent reflecting continued competitive pressures and   regional competition.  Second quarter Ti02 volumes were down 1 percent as volumes in the Americas and Asia Pacific   regions were below the prior year with Europe, Middle East and Africa volumes up in the low-single digits.         In Chemicals and Fluoroproducts, volumes were down 2 percent as lower demand in fluoropolymers, chemicals solutions   and fluorochemicals was partially offset by higher demand for the next generation refrigerant, Opteon&#174; 1234yf, which was   up nearly 30 percent on continued adoption by automotive OEMS.         Segment operating earnings were down 55 percent due primarily to lower Ti02 prices and the negative impact of currency.
