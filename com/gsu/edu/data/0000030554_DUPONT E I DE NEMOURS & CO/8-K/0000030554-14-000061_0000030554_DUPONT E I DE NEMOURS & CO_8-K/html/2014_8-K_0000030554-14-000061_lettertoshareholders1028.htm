<DIV><FONT size="1" style="font-size:1pt;color:white">               DuPont Executive Offices   Wilmington, DE 19898   E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Company   October 28, 2014      Dear DuPont Shareholder:   As we approach the conclusion of 2014, DuPont is advancing its next major era of market driven   innovation - executing a strong plan that is delivering results today while positioning us for future growth.     A year ago, I wrote to you regarding our key decision to separate our Performance Chemicals segment   in mid-2015. We remain on schedule in this significant undertaking, making solid progress toward   creating two strong, independent companies. For DuPont, the separation is a catalyst that will further   advance our effort to extend our leadership in agriculture and nutrition, strengthen and grow our   advanced materials capabilities, and leverage our cross-company skill set to develop a world leading bio-   based industrial business.      Through these strategic priorities, we are helping customers find solutions to capitalize on areas of   growing global demand &#8211; enabling more, safer, nutritious food; creating high performance, cost effective,   energy efficient materials for a wide range of industries; and increasingly delivering renewably sourced   bio-based materials and fuels. We know that our progress, the value we create, and the future we make   possible matter deeply to our customers, the markets they serve, and to you, our shareholders.   DuPont&#8217;s management, Board and people are working with urgency and purpose to build a higher   growth, higher value DuPont through innovation, disciplined and accountable management, and a strong   focus on returns.      BUILDING A HIGHER GROWTH, HIGHER VALUE DUPONT   Several distinct competitive advantages contribute to our ability to create higher growth and higher value   for shareholders in the near- and long-term:     &#61623; Innovation delivery system: All our businesses call upon our world-class science and technology, a   deep understanding of commercial value chains and market knowledge to deliver value-added   solutions for customers. This total system of innovation continually renews our portfolio, creates new   product lines, and transforms markets to deliver results for our shareholders.  In 2013, this system   generated $10 billion in revenue from new products launched over the prior four years.     &#61623; Market access: We are able to build large, global customer relationships, generating new   opportunities in multiple market segments as customers increasingly engage the full range of our   related capabilities.   &#61623; Global penetration: Our Agriculture businesses give our other businesses an edge in penetrating   and expanding in developing countries, which represent the greatest source of global growth for the   foreseeable future. Company sales in developing countries, excluding Performance Chemicals, have   almost doubled in the past five years from $5.0 billion to $9.7 billion.     </FONT></DIV>

<DIV><FONT size="1" style="font-size:1pt;color:white">2      &#61623; Leading position to capture full breadth of bio-based opportunity: We are best positioned with   all the capabilities needed to create new categories of renewably sourced, bio-based materials and   fuels that combine biological and materials sciences and draw on our feedstock knowledge from our   agriculture business. As innovation creates new demand for these products, our pipeline of next-   generation renewable products is poised to drive meaningful growth for DuPont that will create long-   term benefit for our shareholders.      As these advantages and capabilities continue to gain scale, we expect to increase the rate of innovation   from our new product pipeline.  We will continue to adjust our portfolio to keep it centered on high   potential commercial opportunities where DuPont&#8217;s innovation, global scale, and efficient execution can   create valuable new outcomes.   DECISIVE ACTIONS DRIVING VALUE CREATION      The new DuPont is emerging from the decisive actions your management team has taken to deliver   higher growth and higher value over the last several years, including:    &#61623; Ongoing portfolio refinement to focus on emerging areas of opportunity, including the   acquisition of Danisco, the sale of Performance Coatings, the acquisition of Pannar Seeds (Pty) Ltd,   and the pending separation of Performance Chemicals.    &#61623; Aggressive cost management and productivity improvements, which yielded cost reductions of   over $2.0 billion and cumulative working capital savings of over $3.0 billion since 2008. While our   SG&amp;A costs are currently competitive, our operational redesign now underway is the latest wave of   improvement, expected to deliver at least an additional $1 billion in new savings, with two thirds of   that anticipated by the end of 2015 on a run rate basis.    &#61623; Disciplined capital allocation, which will continue to drive higher growth and higher value through   carefully targeted investments in higher growth businesses. We will utilize our balance sheet in a   disciplined manner to grow the value of your company while maintaining flexibility.      Our efforts have delivered results. Since the end of 2008, we delivered total shareholder return of   253% (as of 9/30/14), substantially above the S&amp;P 500, the S&amp;P Chemicals and Materials indices and   our proxy peers across the same period. From 2008 through 2013, we also improved segment adjusted   operating margins1 by 650 bps or 69%.      Portfolio actions, including the sale of Performance Coatings and the pending separation of Performance   Chemicals, have resulted in improved performance.  From 2008 through 2013, DuPont&#8217;s post-spin   businesses increased adjusted segment sales2 by 8% CAGR and segment adjusted operating earnings1   by 20% CAGR.       Returning capital to shareholders remains a hallmark of DuPont.  From 2009 to date, we returned   more than $9 billion to shareholders through dividends, an increase of 12% during this period. In addition                                                               1    Segment adjusted operating earnings and margins are calculated using segment pre-tax operating income (GAAP) less   significant items and certain corporate expenses. Calculations exclude Performance Coatings, Performance Chemicals, Pharma   and Other.  Reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to GAAP are included with this presentation.   2    Segment sales include transfers. CAGR is calculated excluding Performance Coatings, Performance Chemicals and Other.       </FONT></DIV>

<DIV><FONT size="1" style="font-size:1pt;color:white">3      share repurchases have accelerated and we are currently executing a $5 billion share buyback program.    The Board remains committed to an attractive dividend and repurchasing stock, as appropriate.      MOVING FORWARD WITH A STRATEGY THAT IS WORKING    While we have strong momentum, we are never satisfied.  We will continue to pursue the right choices   and decisions to emphasize accountability and build on our track record, including the rigorous, ongoing   review of our portfolio.    Against this backdrop of positive momentum, one of our shareholders, Trian Fund Management, has   publicly disclosed proposals they made previously to our management and Board.  We know that our   investors share our goal of building a higher growth, higher value DuPont and, consistent with our open   approach to investor input, we have held a number of constructive discussions with Trian, and we   consider their ideas within the context of our plan to create higher growth and higher value for   shareholders.   Trian&#8217;s proposals in certain respects are aligned with the direction we set more than five years ago and   the related actions we are taking.  We are aggressively refining our portfolio; we have made cost   reduction and business simplification a way of life, with a major redesign initiative underway that aligns   our cost structure with the company&#8217;s post-spin portfolio; and we have expanded our capital return   program while maintaining a capital structure that supports sustainable growth.      However, we know that our businesses strongly benefit from being a part of DuPont.  In addition to the   benefits of our innovation platforms, market access across large customer relationships, opportunities for   market penetration globally, and our favorable position with which to optimize the bio-based opportunity -   our company is advantaged by our global scale and infrastructure leverage, our established brand and   solid financial foundation.  Our capital structure furthermore provides us with important financial flexibility   we need to pursue strategic growth opportunities in light of regional and highly seasonal agriculture cash   flows. That same strength and flexibility enabled us to continue paying a dividend through the financial   crisis.    Your Board of Directors and management have been active stewards of your investment in DuPont.    Over the past several years, we have delivered results, but, more importantly, we have demonstrated our   determination and commitment to increase the value of DuPont for our shareholders.   We are working with speed and objectivity, and we are on a critical path.  We look forward to updating   you on our progress, as the next great era of DuPont takes shape.    Sincerely,      Ellen Kullman   Chair of the Board and    Chief Executive Officer         </FONT></DIV>

<DIV><FONT size="1" style="font-size:1pt;color:white">4      Use of Non-GAAP Measures: The letter to shareholders contains certain non-GAAP measurements that management believes are meaningful   to investors because they provide insight with respect to operating results of the company. Such measurements are not recognized in   accordance with GAAP and should not be viewed as an alternative to GAAP measures of performance. Furthermore, these measures may not   be consistent with similar measures used by other companies. Reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to GAAP are provided below.             Forward-Looking Statements: This document contains forward-looking statements which may be identified by their use of words like &#8220;plans,&#8221;   &#8220;expects,&#8221; &#8220;will,&#8221; &#8220;believes,&quot; &#8221;intends,&#8221; &#8220;estimates,&#8221; &#8220;anticipates&#8221; or other words of similar meaning.  All statements that address expectations or   projections about the future, including statements about the company&#39;s strategy for growth, product development, regulatory approval, market   position, anticipated benefits of recent acquisitions, timing of anticipated benefits from restructuring actions, outcome of contingencies, such as   litigation and environmental matters, expenditures and financial results, are forward looking statements. Forward-looking statements are not   guarantees of future performance and are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events which may not be realized. Forward-   looking statements also involve risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond the company&#8217;s control. Some of the important factors that   could cause the company&#8217;s actual results to differ materially from those projected in any such forward-looking statements are: fluctuations in   energy and raw material prices; failure to develop and market new products and optimally manage product life cycles; significant litigation and   environmental matters; failure to appropriately manage process safety and product stewardship issues; changes in laws and regulations or   political conditions; global economic and capital markets conditions, such as inflation, interest and currency exchange rates; business or supply   disruptions; security threats, such as acts of sabotage, terrorism or war, weather events and natural disasters; ability to protect and enforce the   company&#39;s intellectual property rights; successful integration of acquired businesses and separation of underperforming or non-strategic assets   or businesses and successful completion of the proposed spinoff of the Performance Chemicals segment including ability to fully realize the   expected benefits of the proposed spinoff. The company undertakes no duty to update any forward-looking statements as a result of future   developments or new information.
