Management   believes the use of these non-GAAP measures are meaningful to investors because they provide insight with respect to operating results of the   company and additional metrics for use in comparison to competitors.  These measures should not be viewed as an alternative to GAAP   measures of performance.  Furthermore, these measures may not be consistent with similar measures used by other companies.  This data   should be read in conjunction with previously published company reports on Forms 10-K, 10-Q, and 8-K.  These reports, are available on the   Investor Center of www.dupont.com.  Reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to GAAP are also included with this presentation.     Forward-Looking Statements   This document contains forward-looking statements which may be identified by their use of words like &#8220;plans,&#8221; &#8220;expects,&#8221; &#8220;will,&#8221; &quot;believes,&quot;   &#8220;intends,&#8221; &#8220;estimates,&#8221; &#8220;anticipates&#8221; or other words of similar meaning.  All statements that address expectations or projections about the   future, including statements about the company&#39;s strategy for growth, product development, regulatory approval, market position, anticipated   benefits of recent acquisitions, timing of anticipated benefits from restructuring actions, outcome of contingencies, such as litigation and   environmental matters, expenditures and financial results, are forward looking statements. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of   future performance and are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events which may not be realized. Forward-looking   statements also involve risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond the company&#8217;s control. Some of the important factors that could   cause the company&#8217;s actual results to differ materially from those projected in any such forward-looking statements are: fluctuations in energy   and raw material prices; failure to develop and market new products and optimally manage product life cycles; significant litigation and   environmental matters; failure to appropriately manage process safety and product stewardship issues; changes in laws and regulations or   political conditions; global economic and capital markets conditions, such as inflation, interest and currency exchange rates; business or supply   disruptions; security threats, such as acts of sabotage, terrorism or war, weather events and natural disasters; ability to protect and enforce the   company&#39;s intellectual property rights; successful integration of acquired businesses and separation of underperforming or non-strategic assets   or businesses and successful completion of the proposed spinoff of the Performance Chemicals segment including ability to fully realize the   expected benefits of the proposed spinoff. The company undertakes no duty to update any forward-looking statements as a result of future   developments or new information.      Developing Markets   Total developing markets is comprised of Developing Asia, Developing Europe, Middle East &amp; Africa, and Latin America.  A detailed list of all   developing countries is available on the Earnings News Release link on the Investor Center website at www.dupont.com.         </FONT></DIV>
