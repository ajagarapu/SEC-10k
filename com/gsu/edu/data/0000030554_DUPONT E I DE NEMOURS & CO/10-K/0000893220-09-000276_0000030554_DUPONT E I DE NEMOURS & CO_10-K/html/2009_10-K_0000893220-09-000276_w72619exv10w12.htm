</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Your employment agreement (&#147;Agreement&#148;) with the Company was most recently amended and restated on
July&nbsp;30, 2004. Subsequent to that date, Section&nbsp;409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (&#147;Code&#148;)
was enacted, which imposes additional income taxes on certain deferred compensation arrangements,
including deferred compensation provided for in employment agreements.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In order for you to avoid the imposition of additional taxes under Code Section&nbsp;409A, it is
necessary that we make certain revisions to your current Agreement. This Agreement reflects those
changes along with updated references. It amends, restates and supercedes our previous Agreement
with you dated July&nbsp;30, 2004, effective as of the date hereof.
