</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The purpose of the DuPont Stock Accumulation and Deferred Compensation Plan for Directors (the
&#147;Plan&#148;) is to permit Directors to defer the payment of all or a specified part of their
compensation for services performed as Directors.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">This amendment and restatement of the Plan (&#147;2009 Restatement&#148;) is intended to reflect the
requirements of Section&nbsp;409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (&#147;Code&#148;) and the
rulings and regulations issued thereunder (collectively, &#147;Code Section&nbsp;409A&#148;) and shall be
administered and construed in accordance with such requirements.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The provisions of this 2009 Restatement shall apply to amounts deferred in taxable years beginning
after December&nbsp;31, 2008. Notwithstanding the foregoing, paragraph 11 of this 2009 Restatement
shall, to the extent provided therein, apply to amounts deferred in taxable years before 2009;
provided, however, that such amounts were not: (i)&nbsp;earned and vested before January&nbsp;1, 2005; and
(ii)&nbsp;paid to a Director on or before December&nbsp;31, 2008. For purposes of this paragraph, a right to
an amount is earned and vested only if the amount is not subject to a substantial risk of
forfeiture for purposes of Code Section&nbsp;409A.

performed as Directors.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Plan shall be administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the
&#147;Committee&#148;). The decision of the Committee with respect to any questions arising as to the
interpretation of this Plan, including the severability of any and all of the provisions thereof,
shall be final, conclusive and binding. The Board of Directors of the Company reserves the right to
modify the Plan from time to time, or to terminate the Plan entirely, provided, however, that (1)
no modification of the Plan shall operate to annul an election already in effect for the current
calendar year or any preceding calendar year; (2)&nbsp;that the foregoing shall not preclude any
amendment necessary or desirable to conform to changes in applicable law, including, but not
limited to, changes in the Code; and (3)&nbsp;upon termination of the Plan, except to the extent
otherwise permitted under Code Section&nbsp;409A, all balances will be distributed in accordance with
the terms of the Plan as in effect on the date of termination.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">It is the Company&#146;s intent that the Plan comply in all respects with Rule&nbsp;16b-3 of the Exchange
Act, or its successor, and any regulations promulgated thereunder. If any provision of this Plan is
found not to be in compliance with such rule and regulations, the provision shall be deemed null
and void, and the remaining provisions of the Plan shall continue in full force and effect. All
transactions under this Plan shall be executed in accordance with the requirements of Section&nbsp;16 of
the Exchange Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder.

services as a Director during the following calendar year.

within thirty days after election to the Board, to defer in the same manner the receipt of the
payment of all or a specified part of fees not yet earned for the remainder of that calendar year
in the form of cash or stock units.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Fees deferred in the form of cash shall be held in the general funds of the Company and shall be
credited to an account in the name of the Director. Deferred cash will bear interest at a rate
corresponding to the average 30-year Treasury securities rate applicable for the quarter (or at
such other rate as may be specified by the Committee from time to time). Interest will be
compounded quarterly and will also be deferred. If the rate changes, the new rate will apply to all
deferred cash amounts beginning with the following quarter. Fees deferred in the form of stock
units shall be allocated to each Director&#146;s account based on the closing price of the Company&#146;s
common stock as reported on the Composite Tape of the New York Stock Exchange (&#147;Stock Price&#148;) on
the date the fees would otherwise have been paid. The Company shall not be required to reserve or
otherwise set aside shares of common stock for the payment of its obligations hereunder, but shall
make available as and when required a sufficient number of shares of common stock to meet the needs
of the Plan. An amount equal to any cash dividends (or the fair market value of dividends paid in
property other than dividends payable in common stock of the Company) payable on the number of
shares represented by the number of stock units in each Director&#146;s account will be allocated to
each Director&#146;s account in the form of stock units based upon the Stock Price on the dividend
payment date. Any stock dividends payable on such number of shares will be allocated in the form of
stock units. If adjustments are made to outstanding shares of common stock as a result of
split-ups, recapitalizations, mergers, consolidations and the like, an appropriate adjustment shall
also be made in the number of stock units in a Director&#146;s account. Stock units shall not entitle
any person to rights of a stockholder unless and until shares of Company common stock have been
issued to that person with respect to stock units as provided in Article&nbsp;7.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The aggregate amount of deferred fees, together with interest and dividend equivalents accrued
thereon, shall be paid in accordance with the time and form of payment elections made by the
Director under paragraph 5. Amounts credited to a Director&#146;s account in cash shall be paid in cash
and amounts credited in stock units shall be paid in one share of common stock of the Company for
each stock unit, except that a cash payment will be made with any final installment for any
fraction of a stock unit remaining in the Director&#146;s account. Such fractional share shall be valued
at the closing Stock Price on the date of settlement. Restricted stock units payable in cash, and
the dividend equivalents associated with such deferred units, shall be paid in cash, each unit to
equal the value of one share of DuPont common stock based on the average of the high and low prices
of DuPont common stock as reported on the Composite Tape of the New York Stock Exchange as of the
effective date of payment.

his or her account under the Plan on such form as may be prescribed by the Committee, and may, from
time to time, amend or revoke such designation. If a Director should die before all deferred
amounts credited to the Director&#146;s account have been distributed, the balance of any deferred fees
and interest and dividend equivalents then in the Director&#146;s account shall be paid to the
Director&#146;s designated beneficiary upon

equivalents thereon, shall not be transferable or assignable, except as may otherwise be provided

PLAN AMOUNTS</div>

provided herein, apply to amounts deferred in taxable years beginning before 2009; provided,
however, that such amounts were not: (i)&nbsp;earned and vested before January&nbsp;1, 2005; and (ii)&nbsp;paid to
a Director on or before December&nbsp;31, 2008. For purposes of this paragraph, a right to an amount is
earned and vested only if the amount is not subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture for
purposes of Code Section&nbsp;409A and the applicable rulings and regulations issued thereunder.
To the extent that an amount is payable in connection with a Director&#146;s retirement or other
separation from service as Director of the Company, no amounts shall be paid hereunder on account
thereof unless such retirement or separation from service constitutes a separation from service
within the meaning of Code Section&nbsp;409A.

be paid no later than the last day of that calendar year.
